            This dashboard is an internal tool to monitor the quality of TruValue Lab’s self-generated and AI-powered data through visualizations. 
            <br><br>
            It assist data analyst to drill down to details and identify the information gap to fill; It also provides a high-level overview for the senior leadership regards to the overall data quality issues. 
            <br><br>
            To leverage the overall quality of TVL’s self-generated data, the data content team have to test the data at each stage throughout the NLP pipeline. The phase I of this Data Quality Dashboard use the data from the data ingestion stage for visualization. The dashboard is designed to be updated at a monthly frequency.

            1.draft product proposal<br><br>
            I came up with a product proposal which listed out a list of tools that could be used to build the data dashboard. Besides, I evaluated their pros and cons. After discussions with the Design and Product Lead and the Engineering Team, we decided to adapt a third party dashboarding tool instead of acquiring any extra input from the engineering team given the nature of a start-up environment. 

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            2.understand the task domain<br>
            I worked closely with the data analysts and data scientists to better understand the task domain for this set of data visualizations. The goal is to ensure that we are on the same page regarding the nature of the data and the potential insights the visualizations could reveal. 

            <br>
            <br>
            3.parsing the data <br>
            The understanding of the task domain went parallel with the process to playing with the complex data pulled from the internal data API. Given the capacities of the dashboarding tool, I optimized the data structure and format to facilitate performance of the tool better. 

            <br>
            <br>
            4.UI/UX design <br>
            With more than 60 diagrams on hand that has been visualized through the dashboarding tool, I grouped them into four different categories based on the type of insights they generated and displayed them on separate pages that the users can toggle between. Besides, a monthly data quality overview page was shown on the landing page which compares some of the KPIs of this month with the previous one.Visual tweaks for colors and overall layout were made to keep the data dashboard visually consistent with other TVL products.  
 
            <br>
            <br>
            5.QA  <br>
            I worked closely with data scientist to QA the node.js and python scripts I wrote for parsing the data. We also tested the quality of pulls from data API to ensure that the data source is working correctly.
